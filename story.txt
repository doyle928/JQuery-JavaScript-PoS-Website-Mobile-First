Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of ninja monkeys.
The band was call "The Monkeys."
This band became a hit instantly battling all the monsters of the Shangrila music scene.
They lived the rockstar life, blow, heroin, and girls.
I live the rockstar life, at night, in my sleep. I call this place â€“ Dreams...
Sometimes my dreams cross the plane of reality, I wake up not knowing where I am or who I am with.
