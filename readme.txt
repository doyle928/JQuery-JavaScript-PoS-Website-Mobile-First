May I safely delete the Dress, Everyday and Jeans folders/html files
and stylestyles.css file?
I resized images, worked on mobile css. Would like to review what I've done for your feedback and
then work on big browser css.
Matthew would you please create a github link for the project (Settings/GitHub pages),
so we can also see our progress online?
